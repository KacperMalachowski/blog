## Who am I?

Hi! My name is Kacper, and I work as a DevOps engineer at a large international corporation. It's a broad term, but in simple words: I deal with automation, infrastructure management, and building environments that support development teams. In practice, that means tweaking configurations, writing scripts, solving problems, ensuring system reliability, and constantly improving processes.

Professionally, I orbit around topics like CI/CD, containerization, orchestration, monitoring, configuration management, and provisioning. Much of it happens in the terminal, because I like to know exactly what's going on under the hood.

## How did I get into IT?

My journey with technology started in a rather unusual way – through modding Minecraft. I was especially fascinated by the ComputerCraft mod, which let you program virtual computers in Lua within the game world. For many kids, it was just fun – for me, it was the first real contact with code and logical thinking in the context of systems.

There wasn't any single person who inspired me – it was pure curiosity that drove me. I’ve always wanted to understand how things work – whether it’s a toy, a computer, or a washing machine. Naturally, that curiosity turned into a passion for computers, and later on, electronics and IT.

As my knowledge grew, I began to realize that I enjoyed not just programming itself, but everything around it – how to deploy an app, secure it, automate its environment, and make everything consistent and reliable. That’s how I ended up in the world of DevOps.

## Why DevOps?

What I appreciate most in my work is the ability to create things that have a real, tangible impact on how systems operate. DevOps – especially in on-prem environments – is one of the few IT disciplines that have a physical dimension. When I configure a server, build a network, or automate infrastructure provisioning, I can literally see the effect of my work.

I also enjoy how DevOps combines many skills: coding, administration, networking, security, logic, documentation, and communication with teams. It’s a field for curious, flexible people who are always ready to learn – because in this space, technology never stands still.

Automation holds a special place in my heart. Few things are more satisfying than watching a task that used to take hours now complete itself in minutes – entirely hands-free. Automation means convenience, but also quality, consistency, and predictability. And in IT, those things are gold.

## What do I do outside of work?

Honestly? I'm still messing with servers and automation in my free time. But even I need to unplug now and then. In my downtime, I enjoy building and tweaking my smart home setup. I love turning a house into more than just a living space – making it respond to presence, adjust lighting, improve comfort and safety.

I also write this blog – not only to share knowledge but to document my journey, organize my thoughts, and maybe... inspire someone who's just starting out on a similar path.

Outside of tech, I really value nature. I love hopping on a bike or heading into the woods or to a lake. It’s my way of disconnecting from screens and the digital buzz. In winter, I switch to skiing or mountain hikes – physical effort and open space give my mind a much-needed break.

## What do I stand for?

I try to live by values that are well captured in a Polish scouting song called “Harcerskie Ideały” (Scout Ideals). Even though my personal views are progressive and libertarian, I care deeply about principles like honesty, responsibility, respect, solidarity, and service. That may sound lofty, but for me, it's about simple rules that help me make good choices – in both work and life.

I believe in personal freedom. As long as someone isn’t hurting others, I don’t interfere in their life. I try to stay open-minded, curious, and empathetic. It doesn’t always work out – but I keep trying.

At work, I take pride in quality and accountability. I’m not afraid to admit mistakes, but I do my best to learn from every situation. I love teaching others and continuously learning myself. Knowledge isn’t a treasure to hoard – it’s something to be shared.

## Why this blog?

There are a few reasons this blog exists. First – to document my journey, discoveries, successes, and mistakes. Second – to share knowledge with others. Maybe my solution to a problem will help someone. Maybe someone will get inspired or start exploring a topic they once found intimidating.

Third – I hope this blog becomes a kind of digital legacy. Just like Horace wrote of a “monument more lasting than bronze,” I want to leave something behind. Not in a grand, dramatic way – more like a collection of thoughts, experiences, scripts, and ideas that might still help someone even when I’m no longer around.

And fourth – I want this blog to say one simple thing: *“You can do it too. Just give it a try.”* You don’t need to be a genius or graduate from an elite university. All you need is curiosity, determination, and a willingness to learn. The rest will follow.
