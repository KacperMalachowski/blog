Thanks to the use of AI, I was able to build a fully functional application in just an hour. I mainly used GitHub Copilot and GPT-4.1 during the process. The app works, is responsive, and has all the required features. You can see the result at [kacpermalachowski.github.io/bingo-app](https://kacpermalachowski.github.io/bingo-app).

# Will AI Take Programmers' Jobs?

There’s a lot of talk online about AI taking away programming jobs. In my opinion, that's not true. AI is a tool that can significantly speed up the application development process, but it can’t replace a developer’s creativity and skill. It’s precisely thanks to AI that I was able to build an app that meets all the requirements in such a short time.

Of course, the requirements for an app used at a single party are quite simple. It just needs to work, be responsive, and allow users to add their own bingo phrases. It doesn’t have to look like a million bucks—but it has to work. And that, mostly, it did.

AI handled the general outline of the bingo app really well. However, I had to step in and clearly point out where it made a mistake. While the app scaled perfectly from the beginning, the text inside the bingo fields did not scale at all.

A short prompt saying it didn’t work was enough for AI to fix the issue in seconds. A few lines of CSS were added, enabling the text to scale within the bingo fields. This shows that AI can be very helpful—but it still can’t replace the human eye and skill.

# The Art of Prompting

The art of writing effective prompts—or questions for AI—is key when working with AI-based tools. In my case, to get the desired results, I had to clearly specify what I wanted to achieve. Sometimes a single sentence was enough for AI to fix the code or add missing functionality. In other cases, I had to be more detailed to get the expected outcome.

Working with AI felt more like pair programming with a junior developer—someone who needs guidance and corrections—than with a full-fledged team member. Without a clear description, AI might not understand exactly what is needed. That’s why being able to express thoughts and expectations clearly and precisely is essential.

# AI Is Just a Tool

Did the introduction of IDEs eliminate the programming profession? No, but it greatly sped up the development process. At the same time, it drastically lowered the barrier to entry. Just like high-level languages did before. AI is another step in that direction. It’s a tool that can significantly ease the programmer's work, but it doesn’t replace their creativity and skills. In my case, AI helped me create an app in a short time, but I was still responsible for its final form and functionality.

That doesn’t mean AI has no downsides. From personal experience, I can say that since I started using AI more often, it’s become harder to solve simple problems on my own. I often rely on AI to find solutions instead of thinking through the problem myself. This can lead to a loss of skills and creativity that are crucial in a programmer's work.

However, being aware of this allows me to limit its use to complex projects. Anywhere speed matters—especially when the code won’t have a long life—AI can be extremely helpful. Still, we as programmers remain responsible for what the AI generates. We must check whether the code is correct, works as expected, and doesn’t introduce bugs.

AI allows us to focus on even higher levels of abstraction. We can create more complex applications that would have previously been out of our reach. It’s a tool that can greatly accelerate the app creation process and let us focus on what really matters.

# Summary

Vibe coding is an approach that can be very effective for quickly building applications. Thanks to AI, I was able to build a fully functional app in just an hour. It’s a tool that can significantly speed up the development process, but it cannot replace human creativity and skill.

However, to fully use AI’s potential, it’s important to be able to clearly express your expectations and be ready to correct its mistakes. AI is just a tool that can make a programmer’s work much easier—but we’re still responsible for the final shape and functionality of the application.

Vibe coding is like coding bootcamps a few years ago. Back then, you could learn the basics and build your first app in just a few weeks. Today, thanks to AI, we can do it even faster and more easily. However, this negatively affects the job market for beginners. It’s no longer enough to just know the basics of programming to land a job. Now, besides using AI, you have to show that you can think critically and solve problems. These are the skills that are essential for a programmer—and ones that AI can’t replace.
