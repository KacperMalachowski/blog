My story as a real software engineer begins in 2020, when I joined TTSK and TD2 project. TD2 is a train simulator created for free by passionate. It's important because at the same time I started my study at the University of Silesia. 

You can say as TD2 is free so it wasn't much consuming and you will be right! It's significant to mention because after year I resign from work on TD2 project.

## First full-time work

In July 2022, I joined my current company for the summer internship. Together with 6 other enthusiast students, we begin our journey at one of the top companies in the world.

It was 3 months of summer, fulfill with a lot of work to make the best of project that we get. After that 3 months I joined the DevOps team, in which I work until this day.

That answers the first part of the title, yes, you can study and work at the same time.

## It's a little problemâ€¦

The organization must be prepared for such type of work! I know numerous people who tried to work and study at the same time, but work was a lot of time-consuming, so they resigned from work.

The approach of the manager and team is significant in such a situation, they have to know that you're not available full-time. As well as, you as the team should prepare some way for cooperation, especially when study took more than less of a week.

For me, it was a little easier because I don't like social life. I don't have many friends, as well as girlfriend. In such a place, I can put full effort into work and studying.

I can image, that keeping in touch with family and friends would be hard, especially during exam sessions. It's not something that everyone will like, but it's still achievable.

## How I achieve that?

Just swapped out my social life for computer science, like I said earlier. Why and how it's a definitely interesting story for next post :wink:. It makes countless things for me easier, but also has a negative impact on my mental health. 

I work basically every possible occasion to keep as many working hours as practicable. I connect it with my pilot role in PaffsAir VA working while cruising in flight simulator and, of course, I connect it with study working between lectures.

## Summary

Such a connection of study and work is always a trade-off in my opinion, so before you decide if it works for you. Please challenge what you get and what you lose in your individual situation.
